Your body simply doesn&#8217;t know when it has a chance to take in more food and it will try to slow things down.<\/p>\n<p>The solution here is to find the diet that works best for you and stick to it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sleepless<\/strong>\n<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that people who don&#8217;t get enough sleep don&#8217;t have as much energy, meaning they&#8217;ll use fewer calories throughout the day. Solution: find a way to get enough sleep about 7-8 hours\/day.<\/p>\n<p>If you have trouble sleeping, use special apps or try herbal tea before bed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Not eating enough<\/strong>\n<p>If you cut calories too much, your body goes into starvation mode and slows down your metabolism to try to retain as much fuel as possible. Tracking your calories is important if you want to lose weight, but don&#8217;t overdo it.<\/p>\n<p>Nutritionists recommend cutting back about 200 kcal for healthy weight loss.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sit too long<\/strong>\n<p>If you spend most of your day at a desk, be aware that sitting for long periods of time can affect your metabolism. Many studies have proven this, and many companies actually encourage their employees to do a few simple stretches every 30 minutes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Not getting enough calcium<\/strong>\n<p>Getting enough calcium is extremely important when it comes to regulating metabolism. If you don&#8217;t like dairy or are lactose intolerant, it doesn&#8217;t matter because there are plenty of other calcium-rich foods out there.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Dehydration<\/strong>\n<p>Every process in our body depends on water. If you&#8217;re dehydrated, your whole body won&#8217;t work as well. One\u00a0 study showed that drinking water (about 500ml) can increase your metabolic rate by up to 30%.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lack of protein<\/strong>\n<p>Protein plays a very important role in weight maintenance. Compared to carbs or fat, protein has a relatively high TEF (a measure of the increase in metabolism that occurs after digestion). Plus, it makes you feel full and you&#8217;ll end up consuming fewer calories.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-560 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/thenewgym.vn\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Picture15-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1379\" height=\"919\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thenewgym.vn\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Picture15-1.jpg 1379w, https:\/\/thenewgym.vn\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Picture15-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thenewgym.vn\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Picture15-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/thenewgym.vn\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Picture15-1-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1379px) 100vw, 1379px\" \/><\/p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong>Exercise to strengthen resistance<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Resistance training increases muscle mass and dramatically increases the number of calories you burn at rest.
